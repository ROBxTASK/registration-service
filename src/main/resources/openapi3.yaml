          description:
            ReturnResult of skill specifies the return value that is returned after the execution
            of the skill. In most cases the return value will be boolean and indicate, whether
            the skill was executed OK or not (NOK). In the skill definition, the specification
            of the return result is optional, i.e. it can also be "void".

          description:
            Describes the status during the execution of a robotic skill.
            Maps to the "Feedback"-Concept when implementing the skill as a ROS Action.
            In many cases, this will be a numeric value describing the completion percentage.
            In the skill definition, the specification of "status" is optional.

    Slot:

            (e.g. Position, Location, OutputMessage, ...)
            There is a 1:n - Relation to the slot type, i.e. based on the SlotName, the SlotType is derived.
        SlotType:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/RxtDataType'
          description:
            The data type required for this slot. Given a specific ROBxTASK version,
            this data type can be derived from the SlotName automatically. Therefore it is an optional.

          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          description:
            Array of allowed values for the defined slot, if SlotType is "Enum". This list shall be defined by the
            implementor of the skill because it may differ from robot to robot depending on the use case.
            For example, if a robot provides predefined positions, such as "parking lot",
            "target position", "start position", etc., then the robot engineer can provide such values to
            help the task designer in the understanding of the specific skill.
            If such values are provided, they shall be presented as "enum" for the task designers, when creating
            processes using that skill, otherwise any value will be accepted.
            Also more specific SlotNames (such as "RobotPosition") are usually also represented as Strings.
